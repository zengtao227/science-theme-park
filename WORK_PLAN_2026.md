## 🎯 Phase 4.2: Quality & Excellence Optimization

### 4.2.1 Advanced Logic & Pedagogy (P1)
- [ ] **4.2.1.5: SC1.06 (Chemical Reactions)** - Upgrade to 3D visualization and ELITE interdisciplinary analysis.
- [ ] **4.2.1.6: Module Cross-Linkages** - Implement "Prerequisite System" UI to guide learning paths.

### 4.2.2 Visualization & Interaction (P1 - NEXT)
- [ ] **4.2.2.1: Physics 3D Expansion** - Implement Three.js/Rapier physics visualization for SP1-SP3 series.
  - Priority: SP1.01 (Forces) 3D playground.
- [ ] **4.2.2.2: Chemistry 3D Assembly** - Complete 3D orbital and VSEPR visualization for SC1.04-SC1.06.
- [ ] **4.2.2.3: Micro-Animations** - Add smooth transitions and "Eureka" effects for correct answers.

### 4.2.3 Real-World Data Integration (P2)
- [ ] **4.2.3.5: Biology Monitoring** - Integrate Rhine local biodiversity time-series data into SB3.01.
- [ ] **4.2.3.6: Physics Energy Audit** - Use Basel IWB real energy consumption patterns for SP3.03.

### 4.2.4 Documentation & Standardization (P3 - Ongoing)
- [x] **4.2.4.1: Documentation Consolidation** - Unified `docs/ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`.
- [ ] **4.2.4.2: Component Library** - Extract shared UI components into a dedicated internal library.

## 🛠️ Execution Strategy (Automated)
1. **P1 Dominance**: Focus on 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 simultaneously.
2. **Zero Regression**: Every new feature must pass 100% automated integrity audits.
3. **Continuous Deployment**: Push verified segments to GitHub to maintain a stable main branch.
