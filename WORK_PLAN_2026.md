## 🛠️ Execution Strategy

### Priority Focus (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **P1 Dominance**: Focus on 4.2.2 (Visualization & Interaction)
   - Start with SP1.01 3D force playground
   - Implement Three.js/Rapier physics engine
   - Add interactive force vector manipulation

2. **Zero Regression**: Every new feature must pass 100% automated integrity audits
   - Run `npm run build` before each commit
   - Verify all existing modules still function
   - Maintain backward compatibility

3. **Continuous Deployment**: Push verified segments to GitHub to maintain a stable main branch
   - Feature branches for experimental work
   - Main branch always deployable
   - Regular integration testing

### Quality Gates
- ✅ TypeScript compilation with zero errors
- ✅ All existing tests passing
- ✅ i18n coverage for all new content (CN, EN, DE)
- ✅ Responsive design verification
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met
