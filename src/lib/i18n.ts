You want to buy a gaming PC that costs 2,000 CHF. Question: how many years until your money doubles? Use logarithms to solve: t = log₂(2000/1000) / log₂(1.08).

But if you use an 8-character password with letters and numbers (62 options per character), there are 62^8 = 218 trillion combinations! At 1 billion tries per second, it takes 218,000 seconds (2.5 days). Question: how many characters needed for 1 year of protection? Use logarithms to solve: n = log₆₂(seconds × tries_per_second).",

By measuring how much ¹⁴C remains, scientists can calculate the age. If the tool has 25% of the original ¹⁴C, how old is it? Use: 0.25 = (1/2)^(t/5730). Solve for t using logarithms.

Für n unabhängige Versuche (Lottoziehungen) berechnen Sie die Wahrscheinlichkeit P(X=k) für genau k Erfolge mit der Binomialverteilungsformel: P(X=k) = C(n,k) × p^k × (1-p)^(n-k). Dies hilft Lotteriebeamten, Auszahlungshäufigkeiten vorherzusagen und Preisstrukturen für Schweizer Spieler festzulegen.",
                conditional: "Basler Versicherungs-Risikobewertung: Basler Versicherungen müssen bedingte Wahrscheinlichkeiten für die Risikobewertung berechnen. Gegeben P(A) = Wahrscheinlichkeit eines Ereignisses, P(B) = Wahrscheinlichkeit einer erfüllten Bedingung und P(A∩B) = Wahrscheinlichkeit beider Ereignisse, berechnen Sie P(A|B) = P(A∩B)/P(B). Diese bedingte Wahrscheinlichkeit hilft, Versicherungsprämien für Basler Einwohner basierend auf spezifischen Risikofaktoren zu bestimmen.",

Jedes Unternehmen präsentiert ein anderes Wahrscheinlichkeitsproblem: Grundwahrscheinlichkeit für Qualitätskontrolle, Binomialverteilung für Lotterieanalyse oder bedingte Wahrscheinlichkeit für Versicherungsrisiko. Wenden Sie die entsprechende Wahrscheinlichkeitsformel an, um die spezifische Herausforderung jedes Unternehmens zu lösen und genaue Wahrscheinlichkeitsberechnungen bereitzustellen."
