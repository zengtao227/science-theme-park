            richter_core: "🌍 SCENARIO: Historical Earthquake Analysis — In 1356, Basel experienced Switzerland's strongest recorded earthquake. Modern analysis estimates the ground amplitude was A = 100,000 micrometers. Calculate the Richter magnitude. Compare this to the 2011 Japan earthquake (M 9.0) which had amplitude 1,000,000,000 micrometers. The logarithmic scale compresses this billion-fold range into manageable numbers (1 to 9).",
            richter_elite: "🌍 SCENARIO: Seismic Energy Comparison — Advanced seismology: The energy released by an earthquake increases by 31.6× for each magnitude unit. If Earthquake A is M 5.0 and Earthquake B is M 7.0, how many times more energy does B release? First, understand that M 7.0 means amplitude is 100× larger than M 5.0 (because 10² = 100). But energy scales as amplitude^1.5, so energy ratio is 100^1.5 = 1,000×. This is why M 7 quakes are catastrophic while M 5 are just 'moderate'."
